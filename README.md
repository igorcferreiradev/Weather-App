# Weather-App
This project is a weather application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that allows users to check the current weather of any city in the world.

It retrieves real-time weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API and presents it in an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

Features:

    City Search: Users can input a city name to fetch the current weather data.
    Weather Information: Displays city name, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition (e.g., Clear, Rain, Snow).
    Dynamic Weather Icons: Changes weather icons based on the current weather condition (Cloudy, Clear, Rain, etc.).
    Error Handling: If the city is not found, an error message with an image is shown.

Technology Used:

    JavaScript: Handles API calls, updates UI, and manages animations.
    HTML: Structures the webpage with input fields, buttons, and weather data display.
    CSS: Styles the app, including animations for smooth transitions and weather icon changes.

Key Features and Design:

    Smooth Transitions: When a city is searched, the app smoothly fades in the weather data or an error message, depending on the search result.
    Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive, making it easy to use on different screen sizes.
    Weather Animations: Dynamic shake animations are used when revealing the results to heighten the suspense and visual appeal.

How to Use:

    Enter a City Name: Type the name of any city into the input field and hit the search button (or press Enter).
    View the Weather: The app will display the weather, including temperature, wind speed, and humidity. If the city is not found, an error message will be shown.
    Weather Conditions: The app updates the weather icon and condition dynamically (Cloudy, Clear, Rain, etc.).
